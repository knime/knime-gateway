  "description" : "\n            This node helps handle missing values found in cells of the input \n            table. The first tab in the dialog (labeled \"Default\") provides \n            default handling options for all columns of a given type. \n            These settings apply to all columns in the input table that are not\n            explicitly mentioned in the second tab, labeled \"Individual\". This\n            second tab permits individual settings for each available column \n            (thus, overriding the default). To make use of this second approach,\n            select a column or a list of columns which needs\n            extra handling, click \"Add\", and set the parameters. Click on the \n            label with the column name(s), will select all covered columns \n            in the column list. To remove this extra handling (and instead use \n            the default handling), click the \"Remove\" button for this column.<br/>\n            Options marked with an asterisk (*) will result in non-standard PMML.\n            If you select such an option, the warning label in the dialog will become\n            red and a warning will be shown during execution of the node.
